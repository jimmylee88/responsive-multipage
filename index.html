        <p>Becky McGillivray is a Muralist and Graphic Artist from Manchester moved by the idea that murals and street art should be accessible for every individual. She has a keen eye for shape, type and icons, picking elements from everyday life to inspire her practice. Her murals spread all kinds of messages, from words of affection to thoughtful talking points. Vivid colours and iconography create the visual language you experience on a wall she's painted.</p>
        <p>She's a co-founder of Overspray Collective, A Street Art Collective in Manchester working to make painting in public spaces accessible and safer for women and anyone within a marginalised group. She's also part of The Matchbox Collective and a resident artist at <a href="https://www.peoplewithgrit.org/artists/becky-mcgillivray">GRIT Studios</a>, Manchester.</p>
