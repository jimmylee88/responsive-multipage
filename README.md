# Responsive Multi-page project â€” HTML & CSS week 2 challenge

## Intro
Our task this week is to develop upon some basic wireframes we created for a website idea. 
Week 2 was our introduction to flexbox and responsive layouts. The challenge is to incorporate these into our website projects that need to include multiple pages that link between each oher.
It should build upon concepts and elements we learned from the previous week, including use of CSS variables to better organise commonly used styles.

## Approach
During the class, I was thinking of creating a website for a local artist who wanted someone to re-design their current website.
I started by sketching out a basic wireframe of how the homepage could look.
