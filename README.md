## Intro
Our assignment this week is to develop upon some basic wireframes we created for a website idea.

Week 2 was our introduction to flexbox for responsive layouts. The challenge is to incorporate these into our website projects that need to include multiple pages that link between each oher.
It should build upon concepts and elements we learned from the previous week, including use of CSS variables to better organise commonly used styles.

## Approach
During the class, I was thinking of creating a website for a local artist who wanted someone to re-design their current website.
I started by sketching out a basic wireframe of how the homepage could be laid out. From a UX flow perspective, I wanted to trim down the number of pages the artist currently has. They have a splash page, homepage, about page, project indexes for murals and graphic design, and a contact page. I feel that it could be reduced down to just 3, with the homepage incorporating the information from the about page, and the contact form as they're relatively short. It felt a bit unnecessary for a user to click so much between different pages.
